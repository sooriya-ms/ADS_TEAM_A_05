MINI PROJECT

ABSTRACT:  
In the realm of online gaming, this project introduces a 
novel 9x9 chess board platform, deviating from the conventional
8x8 standard to provide players with an expanded and enriched
gaming experience. This project delves into the domain of online
gaming, presenting a web-based board game application centered
around a 9x9 board. The primary goal is to cultivate an engaging
online gaming experience, incorporating features that not only
enable real-time gameplay but also facilitate movement tracking
and user interaction. Leveraging the capabilities of React JS, the
system constructs a dynamic board game, recording player
movements in a dedicated online MongoDB Atlas database.
Unique to this application are additional functionalities, including
a coin movement track sheet, timed game sessions, and robust
movement validation with associated alerts. The envisioned
system aims to elevate the overall gaming experience, providing
players with a seamless, feature-rich platform for enjoying and
preserving their gameplay history. The paper showcases the
versatility and adaptability of these methods, which can be
applied to a wide array of gaming scenarios, as well as other
fields such as inventory management and security surveillance.
Traditional board games have taken on a new dimension with this
technology, offering players a heightened gaming experience. The
objective of this research is to precisely identify the coin pieces
from the real-time images and videos from various board games.
This paper aims to construct a Deep Learning model that
combines the Yolo technique and OpenCV.

STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:  
1 -> Download the yoloCustom.ipynb file.  
2 -> Install the required libraries.  
3 -> Run the cells, it will download and run the YOLO v8 Algorithm.  
4 -> The results will be saved.
